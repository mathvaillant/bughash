# BugHash App (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

This project was developed by [Matheus Vaillant](https://github.com/mathvaillant).

### This is a portfolio oriented React Project, but is useful for anyone who would like to track the bugs and don't forget all the details about them. (where, how, when, what makes it happen and etc).
